\##Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
instacart = 
  instacart |> 
  as_tibble()
```

The size of the dataset is 1384617rows and 15 columns. The important
varables are `order_id`, `product_id`, `add_to_cart_order`, `reordered`
and `user_id`.There are several order-level variables, describing the
day and time of the order, and number of days since prior order. Then
there are several item-specific variables, describing the product name
(e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and
aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item has been ordered
by this user in the past. In total, there are 39123 products found in
131209 orders from 131209 distinct users.
